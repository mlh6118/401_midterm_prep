### Conflict Plan
#### Process to resolve conflict
1. If a vote is 3 - 1, the team shall try to incorporate aspects of the 
    dissenting vote.
2. Bring up issues as they arise rather than waiting.
3. Discuss conflict in a civilized manner. Objective is to make sure that we 
   understand the root of the conflict.
4. If a majority of the team agreed on conflict resolution, then conflict is 
   resolved.
5. If each team member has a different opinion about the resolution or a 
   situation arises that is not solvable among team members, then the team 
   will get a mediator.
6. If one person takes over the project, it is the responsibility of the other 
   team members to follow the conflict plan and address the situation.
7. As team members we will leverage each others strengths,while balancing what 
   we want to get out of the project and completing the work on a timely manner.
8. In cases where we have knowledge gaps and not enough time to learn, we will 
   together decide the balance between learning and coding.
9. If a member is not adequately contributing, the other team members will 
   have a respectful conversation to understand the situation and asked for a change in output.
10. If point 1 and 2 of conflict plan fails, then team will escalate conflict to 
    mediator.

  * Individual contributor branches

* Repository sharing will be done via an organization on GitHub.

* Git Flow:
  1. Individual pushes changes up to their contributor branch.
  2. Individual performs a pull request from contributor branch to staging 
     branch.
  3. Two other team members look at the contribution.  One of these members 
     will merge the pull request from the contributor branch to staging branch.
  4. Team reviews changes and merge into production branch after all code is 
     staged and tested only after MVP is achieved.
